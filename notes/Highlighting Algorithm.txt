What choices we make to go to next "element"?

 1) If I'm in <#text> element
    a. See if I get a word. If I don't get another word, then find the next element to read from.

 2) If I'm inside an equation
    a.  Go to next element.

 3) If I'm inside an image
    a. Go to next element.

 4) If I'm in *anything* else
    a. Get the first child of it
      i. If it's a #text, then get first word and be done
      ii. If it's an equation, stop there.
      iii. If it's an image, stop there.
      iv. Otherwise, get the first child of that
