I got the speach to work for pyttsx. What I had to do is:


1. using a command window, go to the folder where "ex_setup" is and run it. 

	a. get to the folder it is stored in by using the cd command

	b. Once in the folder, just do "ez_setup install" and it should install it for your python program.

2. once that is installed, you can install py modules much easier. You now go into the pyttsx-1.1 folder and install the setup.py. Since you have the installer in python it should install without problems.

3. Run python, I used pythonwin that was installed in the next step, but any should work. To get it to talk, you need to: 

a. type in import pyttsx
This gets the module that you installed earlier. If you get an error like "can't find pyttsx module", then its not installed properly

b. type in engine = pyttsx.init()
This starts the engine for the operating system. If you get an error like "module win32com.client is missing" then you need to do step 5. 

c. type in engine.say('Text goes here')
This will send the text in the single quotes to the engine to be stored (I think that is how it works)

d. type in engine.runAndWait()
This is when the program will actually say the stuff you added before.

4.That is just to get it to say stuff, for more options and commands, here is a good guide to pyttsx:

5. I was missing a win32com.client since my computer is 64 bits (at least I think that's why I was missing it) so if step 3 doesn't work and you get something like "Module win32com.client is missing" go here for the download that got it to work for me:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe/download

then just run the exe and finish the installation.
